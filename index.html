    <p style="color:red"><i>warning 2: this will run infinitely and may break your pc if you don't close the popups</i></p>
    <p>i think this only supports on chrome (maybe firefox and other pc browsers but i havent tried)</p>
    <p>this only works when this page is currently open</p>
    <p>if you are on mobile (i tried this on safari on iphone) then don't worry about the recursive windows popping up because they only have one tab open</p>
    <p style="color:lime">tip: use a macro or something that closes the windows for you</p>
    <p style="color:lime">set your cursor into the close position of the popup and close a certain amount of windows at a period</p>
